# FFM Projekt
Forest Fire Monitoring System

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani <br />
Advisor: Mr. Carlos Nodarse (BCA) <br />
Context: BCA Mechatronics Research <br />
Projekt Name: FFM: A Novel Idea in the Prevention of Forest Fires using Engineering <br />
Start Date: September 30, 2020 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research projekt and its related fields of engineering. This projekt was my first ever engineering/research projekt. This was started freshmen year of highschool, during the Global COVID-19 Pandemic, during virtual school, and later during the begining of sophomore year when we finally came back to in-person learning. This was done as a part of my time in the Mechantronics Research Program under Mr. Carlos Nodarse. The idea of this projekt was sparked (haha, get the pun?) after hearing about the devestating forest fires in California. This was then made to help combat such an event from ever happening again. This was later entered into the Bergen County Academies Research Expo in 2022, receiving 3rd place 
enviromental research. This projekt has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
