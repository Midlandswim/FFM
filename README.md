# FFM Project
Forest Fire Monitoring System

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani <br />
Advisor: Mr. Carlos Nodarse (BCA) <br />
Context: BCA Mechatronics Research <br />
Project Name: FFM: A Novel Idea in the Prevention of Forest Fires Using Engineering <br />
Start Date: September 30, 2020 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research project and its related fields of engineering. This project was my first ever engineering/research project. This was started freshmen year of high school, during the Global COVID-19 Pandemic, during virtual school, and later during the beginning of my sophomore year when we finally came back to in-person learning. This was done as a part of my time in the Mechatronics Research Program under Mr. Carlos Nodarse. The idea of this project was sparked (haha, get the pun?) after hearing about the devastating forest fires in California. This was then made to help prevent such an event from ever happening again. This was later entered into the Bergen County Academies Research Exposition in 2022, receiving 3rd place in environmental engineering research. This project has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
